# API Checker

--May not be of much use to any other person, it's highly specific to what i wanted, and will be so in starting work later on maybe`

--INCOMPLETE-- (Focusing on my other project)
Work postponed for future, as a practise for learning about ASIO

# Usage (as of now)
```sh
make
./send URL:PORT
```
Example executions ->
* `./send localhost`
* `./send localhost:4000`
* `./send localhost POST`
or other URL, BUT FOR NOW, IT ONLY HITS THE API, TO SEE IF IT'S RUNNING, OR IF YOUR API CODE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES TILL RESPONSE (Sometimes my code gives 500, so i made this for that moments)
